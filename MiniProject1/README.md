# Project 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis

Conducting exploratory analysis on one of the most famous datasets for Machine Learning.
The iris dataset bring information on 3 types of plants. 
This dataset is commonly used in classification machine learning problems, when our goal is to predict the class of the data. 
In the case of this dataset, predict the category of a plant based on measurements of the plant (sepal and petal).
